## Chat history

When building a chatbot agent with multiple back and forths, you previously needed to keep track of the conversation history, since LLM requires the full context of the conversation to generate a response.

To make it easier to manage the chat history, AnotherAI provides a managed storage for all chat agents, so you can only pass the last message to AnotherAI along with a `reply_to_run_id` parameter, and the previous messages of the conversation will be added by AnotherAI automatically.

### How it Works

When AnotherAI receives a request containing `reply_to_run_id`, it performs these steps before calling the underlying LLM:

1.  Looks up the run associated with the provided `reply_to_run_id`.
2.  Retrieves the complete `messages` array (including system, user, and assistant turns) from that historical run.
3.  Prepends these historical messages to the `messages` array sent in the current request.
4.  Sends the combined message list to the target language model.

### Benefits

- **Simplified State Management:** Offloads the burden of storing and transmitting potentially long conversation histories from your client application.
- **Reduced Payload Size:** Your client only needs to send the latest user message(s), significantly reducing the size of the API request payload for long conversations.
- **Seamless Agent/Chatbot Development:** Makes building multi-turn conversational agents much easier, as AnotherAI handles the context continuity.

This feature effectively turns the stateless chat completion endpoint into a stateful one, managed by AnotherAI based on the run history.

### Example

#### Simple example

```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    ]
)

# get the conversation id
conversation_id = response.id

# send a new message to the conversation
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "My name is John."}
    ],
    extra_body={
        "reply_to_run_id": conversation_id
    }
)
```

#### Using deployments

You can combine the Deployments feature with the stateful conversation feature (`reply_to_run_id`) to easily manage conversational context while using server-managed model configurations.

**Mechanism:**

Make an API call specifying:

1.  The target deployment in the `model` parameter: `model="<agent-name>/#<schema_id>/<deployment-id>"`
2.  The previous run ID in the `extra_body`: `extra_body={"reply_to_run_id": "chatcmpl-xxxx"}`
3.  Typically, only the *new* user message(s) in the `messages` array.

**How it Works:**

When both are provided, AnotherAI performs the following:

1.  Retrieves the full message history from the run specified by `reply_to_run_id`.
2.  Identifies the **model** associated with the `<agent-name>/#<schema_id>/<deployment-id>` from your Deployment configurations.
3.  Prepends the retrieved history to the new message(s) provided in the current request's `messages` array.
4.  Sends the combined message list to the **model specified by the Deployment**.

**Important Interaction Note:** In this specific scenario (using both `reply_to_run_id` and a Deployment ID), the prompt template defined within the Deployment configuration is **not applied**. The message history fetched via `reply_to_run_id` provides the necessary context, and the Deployment ID primarily serves to select the correct model for the next turn in the conversation. Any `input` variables in `extra_body` will apply to templates within the *new* message(s) provided in the current call.

**Benefit:** This allows you to maintain conversation state effortlessly using `reply_to_run_id` while ensuring that the appropriate, environment-specific model (managed via Deployments) is used for generating the next response.
