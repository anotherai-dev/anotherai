## What are tools?

Tools are a way to extend the capabilities of your AI agent.

Real-life use cases for tools:
- Search the web to gather the latest news about a company or topic.
- Browse a specific web page to extract information for a report.
- Execute a SQL query to fetch monthly sales data from a company database.
- Search in a vector database to find similar documents or images based on content.
- Send an email to a prospect after identifying information about their company online.

Tools have two forms:

| Type              | Description                                                                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hosted Tools**  | AnotherAI-built tools (web search, browser). Hosted tools do not require any code or engineering effort. |
| **Custom Tools**  | Developer-defined tools. Custom tools will require you to write code to handle the tool calls.   |

Here is a comparison of hosted tools and custom tools to help you decide which is best for your use case:

| **Hosted Tools** | **Custom Tools** |
|------------------|------------------|
| ✅ Works out of the box with no setup or code required.<br />✅ Billing is integrated.<br />❌ Limited to the tools available.<br />❌ No customization possible. | ✅ Fully customizable to your needs.<br />✅ Can integrate with any system.<br />✅ Billing can be integrated for your custom tool.<br />❌ Need to manage API keys and billing for each tool (when relevant).<br />❌ Requires engineering effort. |

## What hosted tools are available?

AnotherAI currently supports tools for:
- Web search: using Google and Perplexity
- Browser: using a text-based browser

## How to use hosted tools?

### From code

To add a hosted tool to your agent, find the tool name (`@tool`) and add it to your agent prompt.

For example, to use the `@google-search` tool, you can add the following to your agent prompt:

```python
messages = [
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "Use @google-search to find the weather in {{location}}."
},
]
```

AnotherAI will automatically add the tool mentioned in the `tools` parameter sent to the LLM.

### From the Playground

[TODO: adjust when the proxy playground is available with tools]

Tools can be added in the Playground by either:
1. Describing the use case to the playground chat agent 
2. Under "Version" tap on the tools you want to enable.

[TODO: video how to add a tool from the playground]

### Web search

AnotherAI supports two web search tools:
- `@google-search` makes a web search using Google
- `@perplexity-sonar-pro` makes a web search using Perplexity's Sonar Pro model

<Tabs items={["Google Search", "Perplexity"]}>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  messages = [
      {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "Use @google-search to find the weather in {{location}}."
      }
  ]
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```python
  messages = [
      {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "Use @perplexity-sonar-pro to summarize the latest news about {{topic}}."
      }
  ]
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

TODO: clarify that tools are used for web search
> Looking into prompt details for a run it seems there is some observability on the google search
> Do you have some doc about it ? What is generating the sweb search query ?

### Browser (text-only)

Use the tool `@browser-text` to extract text from a web page.

```python
messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "Use @browser-text to extract the company name, number of employees, and email address from {{company_url}}."
    }
]
```

### All tools

TODO: make a table with all the tools using the `/v1/tools/hosted` endpoint

### List hosted tools programmatically

You can list all the hosted tools programmatically:
- by calling the `list_hosted_tools` tool from the MCP server
- by calling the `/v1/tools/hosted` endpoint (no authentication required)

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.anotherai.com/v1/tools/hosted" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
```

We're working on adding more tools, if you need any specfic tool, please open a discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/anotherai/anotherai/discussions/categories/ideas) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/auuf8DREZh)
</Callout>

## Custom tools

### From code

AnotherAI is fully compatible with the `tools` parameter from the OpenAI `chat.completions` API, so you can use your existing code without modification.

For more details, refer to OpenAI's documentation on [tools and function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

```python
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogotá, Colombia"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "location"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": False
        },
        "strict": True
    }
}]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls)
```
