Suppose you have an agent that is working well, but is used in your product very often and racking up costs. With AnotherAI you have instant access to 100+ different models, so you can easily explore if there is a cheaper model that can deliver the same quality at a fraction of the cost.

### Finding a cost-effective model

<Steps>
<Step>
Ask Claude to create an experiment comparing your current model against cheaper alternatives

`Help me find the most cost effeective model to use on @calendar_event_extractor.py. Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and quality drop.`
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to be sure to test with real data, you can modify your prompt to include that instruction

`Help me find the most cost effeective model to use on @calendar_event_extractor.py. Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and quality drop. Use the inputs from the last 50 production completions.`

Alternatively, if you have a dataset of standard test inputs you like to use to validate changes, you can modify your prompt to include that instruction:

`Help me find the most cost effeective model to use on @calendar_event_extractor.py. Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and quality drop. Use the inputs from @email_test_cases.txt`

</Step>
