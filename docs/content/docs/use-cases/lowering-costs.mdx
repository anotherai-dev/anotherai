Suppose you have an agent that is working well, but is used in your product very often and racking up costs. With AnotherAI your AI assistant gets instant access to 100+ different models, so it can help you find a cheaper model that can deliver the same quality at a fraction of the cost.

## Identifying Cost Issues

Before optimizing costs, you need to understand your current spending. To get an overview of your current spending, you can view your [organization's metrics](https://anotherai.dev/metrics).

Your AI assistant can also help identify cost trends and anomalies:

```
Compare the costs of my agents and identify which ones are the most expensive to run. 
Show me any agents where costs have increased significantly recently.
```

⏺ Cost Analysis Summary

**Most Expensive Agents (Total Cost)**

Top 5 by Total Spend:
1. email-subject-generator - $314.60 (241K runs)
2. task-extractor - $240.41 (329K runs)
3. daily-summary-writer - $229.95 (324K runs)
4. content-summarizer - $120.80 (168K runs)
5. document-analyzer - $72.78 (168K runs)

Top 5 by Cost Per Run:
1. research-assistant - $0.0095/run
2. customer-chat-bot - $0.0093/run
3. data-extractor - $0.0054/run
4. draft-generator - $0.0044/run
5. report-builder - $0.0043/run

**Agents with Significant Recent Cost Increases**

Massive Increases (>1000% daily average):
- contact-finder: +5,343% increase (from $0.33 to $13.57 in last 3 days)
- data-extractor: +2,038% increase (from $0.22 to $3.56)
- query-parser: +2,018% increase (from $0.16 to $2.52)
- customer-chat-bot: +1,822% increase (from $1.76 to $25.40)
- entity-extractor: +1,712% increase (from $0.35 to $4.76)

High-volume agents with large increases (>500%):
- daily-summary-writer: +1,228% increase (294K runs in last 3 days)
- task-extractor: +560% increase (274K runs in last 3 days)
- email-subject-generator: +527% increase (198K runs in last 3 days)
- content-summarizer: +570% increase (140K runs in last 3 days)

The cost increases appear to be primarily driven by increased usage volume rather than per-run cost changes, as most agents show stable or only slightly increased average costs per run.

## Finding a Cost-Effective Model

<Steps>
<Step>
Ask your AI assistant to create an experiment comparing your current model against cheaper alternatives

```
Help me find the most cost effective model to use on anotherai/agent/calendar-event-extractor. 
Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and 
quality drop.
```
</Step>
<Step>
If you want to be sure to test with real data, you can modify your prompt to include that instruction

```
Help me find the most cost effective model to use on anotherai/agent/calendar-event-extractor. 
Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and 
quality drop. Use the inputs from the last 50 production completions.
```

Alternatively, if you have a [dataset](/use-cases/fundamentals/evaluating#using-datasets-to-evaluate-your-agents) of standard test inputs you like to use to validate changes, you can modify your prompt to include that instruction:

```
Help me find the most cost effective model to use on anotherai/agent/calendar-event-extractor. 
Compare the cheaper models with my current model to assess the cost difference and 
quality drop. Use the inputs from @email_test_cases.txt
```

Your AI assistant will create the experiment and give you an initial analysis of the results and well as a URL to view the results in the AnotherAI web app.
