## Migrating From OpenAI to AnotherAI

The easiest way to migrate your agent is to ask your preferred AI assistant to handle it for you.

<Callout type="info">
Looking for help with migrating your agent? We're happy to help. Reach us at [team@workflowai.support](mailto:team@workflowai.support) or on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/anotherai-dev/shared_invite/zt-3av2prezr-Lz10~8o~rSRQE72m_PyIJA).

If you want to keep your agent as is in code with minimal changes, you can ask your AI assistant to do the following:

```
Migrate my agent at @[your-agent-file-path] to use AnotherAI. 
I want to keep my agent as is in code, but just add access to 
AnotherAI's features
```

If your agent isn't currently using [input variables](/integrations/openai#1-input-variables) or [structured output](/integrations/openai#2-structured-outputs), you can ask your AI assistant to update your agent's code to use them during the migration:

```
Migrate my agent at @[your-agent-file-path] to use AnotherAI. 
I want to keep the same prompt, but update the code to use input variables and structured output.
```

## Migrating from WorkflowAI to AnotherAI

If you're a previous WorkflowAI user, any completions created after [insert date] on WorkflowAI will be automatically available in the AnotherAI web app. The completions can be used by your AI coding agent to recreate an identical agent in your codebase to use in AnotherAI. 

<Steps>
<Step>

Go to https://anotherai.dev/agents

</Step>
<Step>

Select the agent that you want to migrate

</Step>
<Step>

Scroll down the agent's page to view the recent completions and select a completion that uses the version of your agent that you want to migrate

</Step>
<Step>

Copy the completion ID
[TODO: IMAGE OF DETAIL VIEW WITH COMPLETION ID]

</Step>
<Step>

Send the following prompt to your preferred AI assistant:
```
Migrate this version of my agent to AnotherAI: 
anotherai/completion/01993f2d-1fdf-72e5-6847-ad428ea113ce
```

</Step>
</Steps>


Your AI assistant will take care of the steps to migrate the agent to AnotherAI including: 
- Fetching prompts from WorkflowAI deployments
- Converting WorkflowAI SDK calls to OpenAI completion calls
- Setting up API keys and client configuration
- Handling structured outputs and metadata

The migration process ensures your existing WorkflowAI agents work seamlessly with AnotherAI while gaining access to additional features.

## Migrating Away from AnotherAI

We have a zero lock-in promise, so you can try AnotherAI risk-free. If it doesn't provide value, switching back takes minutes, not months.


To switch away from AnotherAI:
- Remove `base_url="{{API_URL}}/v1"`
- If you're not using deployments: your code stays identical
- If you are using deployments: simply ask your AI assistant to fetch your deployment configuration to recreate the equivalent configuration in your code.

If you have any questions or encounter any issues with switching away from AnotherAI, please reach out to [us](mailto:team@workflowai.support).
