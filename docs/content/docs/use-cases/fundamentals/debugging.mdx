# Debugging Agent Issues

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

If you noticed issues with your agent, the easiest way to debug is to use your AI assistant to investigate the issue.

<Steps>

### Describe the Issue to your AI assistant

Open your AI assistant (or your preferred AI coding agent) and describe the issue you're experiencing. Depending on the nature of the issue, your description can contain different information. 

**Using Specific Completion Links:**
If you've identified a specific problematic completion, you can copy the completion ID from the completions detail view (button in the top right of the modal) and share it:

```
This completion anotherai/completion/0198c34b-ff24-73cb-57d8-a67851e0cf10 
input tone was enthusiastic, but the rewritten email isn't very enthusiastic. 
Help me understand what's going wrong.
```

**Using Metadata (Especially Useful for Customer Issues):**
If you receive a report of an issue from a user and utilize metadata - like user emails or ids - to tie completions to a specific user, you can debug more generally without needing specific completion IDs. 

```
john@example.com reported that their email was not rewritten in the correct tone by 
@email_reimaginer. Find why the agent did not work well for customer john@example.com 
and help me understand how to fix the issue.
```

</Step>

### Your AI assistant Does the Rest!

Your AI assistant will debug for you by examining the completion and agent details and input variables. After the issue is identified, you can use your AI assistant to help you rewrite your agent's code to fix the issue.

## Common Issues your AI assistant Can Help Debug

- **Prompt engineering problems** - Suboptimal prompts leading to poor outputs
- **Input validation issues** - Malformed or unexpected input data
- **Model selection problems** - Wrong model chosen for the task
- **Cost optimization** - Identifying expensive patterns or inefficient configurations
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Slow completions or timeout issues

## Tips
- Try to always provide a link to at least one completion with the issue present in AnotherAI's web app to make it easier for your AI assistant to understand the issue.
- Always test your updates with a few different inputs to avoid missing surprise regressions with your updates.
