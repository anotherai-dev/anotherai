This guide walks you through the process of deploying a version of your agent using AnotherAI and your AI coding agent.

## Creating a Deployment

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select and Deploy Your Version

<Tabs items={["From An Experiment", "From Your Code", "From a Completion"]}>
<Tab>
If you're using experiments to make improvements to your agent, you can always deploy the updated version of your agent from the experiments web view

1. Locate the experiment that has the version of the agent you want to deploy.
2. Hover over the version number to copy the version ID

![Deploy Version](/images/deploy-version-popup.png)

3. Open Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent)
4. Request deployment to your preferred environment:

```
I want to deploy anotherai/version/acf2635be31cbd89f9363bfd3b2c6abc to production.
```
</Tab>

<Tab>
If you're making changes to your agent in your IDE, you can also just request to have a deployment created directly, without opening the web app.

1. Ensure your code is already using the AnotherAI SDK with an `agent_id`
2. Tell Claude (or your AI coding agent) to deploy your agent:

```
Deploy the version of my @travel-assistant.py that uses GPT-5 to production
```

Claude will create a version ID for you and deploy it. 

</Tab>

<Tab>
If you find a version via the completions view on the web app, you can also deploy it directly from there.

1. Open the detail view of the completion using the version you want to deploy
2. Copy the version ID (located on the right side of the modal)

![Completion Version Details](/images/completion-version-details.png)

3. Paste the version ID into Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent) and ask it to deploy:

```
I want to deploy fc1ddfbb1cf220716ab7c999b3c89020 to production.
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Common environment names

- `dev` - for development testing
- `staging` - for pre-production validation
- `production` or `prod` - for live production use

When deployed, these environments are combined with your agent name:
- `travel-assistant/dev#1`
- `calendar-assistant/staging#2` 
- `customer-support/production#1`

Optionally, you can request a specific name be used for the deployment. Otherwise, your AI coding agent will pick one for you automatically:

```
I want to deploy anotherai/version/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e to production.
Name the deployment: "calendar-assistant/production-9-2"
```

</Step>


<Step>
### Update Your Code

Once the deployment is created, ask Claude to update your code to use the new deployment.

```
Update my agent code to use the new deployment travel-assistant/production#1
```

Claude will update your code to use the deployment reference, removing the static components that are now stored in the deployment.

**Before:**

<Tabs items={["OpenAI SDK (JS)", "OpenAI SDK (Python)"]}>
<Tab>
```js
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are an expert travel assistant specializing in {{ country }}.

Key responsibilities:
- Provide accurate information about {{ country }} including culture, customs, and travel tips
- Consider the traveler's budget level: {{ budget_level }}
- Recommend activities and restaurants appropriate for their interests and budget

Always be helpful, accurate, and culturally sensitive.`
    }
  ],
  temperature: 0.7,
  // Input variables
  input: {
    country: destination,
    budget_level: travelerBudget
  },
  agent_id: "travel-assistant"
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```python
completion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": """You are an expert travel assistant specializing in {{ country }}.

Key responsibilities:

- Consider the traveler's budget level: {{ budget_level }}
- Recommend activities and restaurants appropriate for their interests and budget

Always be helpful, accurate, and culturally sensitive."""
        }
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    extra_body={
        "input": {
            "country": destination,
            "budget_level": traveler_budget
        },
        "agent_id": "travel-assistant"
    }
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**After:**

<Tabs items={["OpenAI SDK (JS)", "OpenAI SDK (Python)"]}>
<Tab>
```js
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  // Static components are now stored in the deployment
  model: "anotherai/deployment/travel-assistant:production#1",
  messages: [],
  input: {
    country: destination,
    budget_level: travelerBudget
  }
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```python
completion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
    # Model, temperature, system message, and agent_id are now in the deployment
    model="anotherai/deployment/travel-assistant:production#1",
    messages=[],
    extra_body={
        "input": {
            "country": destination,
            "budget_level": traveler_budget
        }
    }
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Steps>

## Updating a Deployment

There are two types of deployment updates that can be made: breaking and non-breaking. To learn more about the differences, read more [here](./index#creating-new-vs-updating-existing-deployments).

### Non-Breaking Changes (Update Existing Deployment)

When your changes don't affect the input variables or output schema, you can update the existing deployment:

<Steps>
<Step>
Copy the new version ID you want to deploy from [AnotherAI](https://anotherai.dev).
</Step>

<Step>
  Ask Claude to update the existing deployment: ``` Update deployment travel-assistant/production#1 to use
  anotherai/version/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e ```
</Step>

<Step>Confirm the update in the AnotherAI web app when prompted.</Step>

<Step>
That's it! **No code changes needed** - your application automatically uses the updated version.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Breaking Changes (Create New Deployment)

When your changes affect input variables or output schema, you must create a new deployment. This is because changing these would cause mismatches between what the deployment expects and what your code provides - for example, if the deployment expects a new input variable that your code isn't passing, or if your code expects an output field that no longer exists.

<Steps>
<Step>
Copy the new version ID you want to deploy from [AnotherAI](https://anotherai.dev).
</Step>

<Step>
  Ask Claude to deploy the new version to your preferred environment in a new deployment. Alternatively, if you ask
  Claude to update an existing deployment and it cannot because the new version is incompatible, Claude will
  automatically create a new deployment for you.
</Step>

<Step>
Update your code to use the new deployment name:
```
Update my code to use travel-assistant/production#2 instead of travel-assistant/production#1
```
</Step>
</Steps>

TODO: the following was taken from an example/use case; pasting here to ensure that I utilize anything useful from it

## Deploy Agent Fixes

This use case demonstrates how to deploy prompt improvements and model changes without modifying your production code.

### Overview
Suppose you've identified and fixed issues with your calendar event extraction system message. Now you need to deploy the improvement to production. For non-breaking changes, AnotherAI's deployment feature lets you update your agent's behavior instantly without touching any production code.

<Steps>
<Step>
After validating improvements in an experiment, deploy the best performing version

`Deploy version anotherai/deployment/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e to production for calendar_event_extractor.py`
</Step>
<Step>
For [non-breaking changes](/deployments#what-updates-are-compatible-with-an-existing-deployment), you can deploy the new version to your existing deployment without making any code changes. Just ask Claude to update the deployment for you:

`Update deployment calendar-event-extractor/production#1 to use anotherai/deployment/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e`
</Step>
<Step>
For [breaking changes](/deployments#creating-a-new-deployment), Claude will automatically create a new deployment for you. In these cases, you will need to update your code to use the new deployment id.

</Step>
</Steps>
