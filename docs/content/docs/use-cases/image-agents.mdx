title: Image Agents
---

Building agent
- Reiterate content from building agent page, but make example prompts and screenshots applicable to image 
- Note workaround for incorrect agent formatting: https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai/issues/340
- Strongly recommend using Opus as Sonnet wasted a lot of time

Image dataset (?)
- Example format 
- Benefits of using a dataset for testing, since AI is inconsistent about generating valid image URLs as input

Note that images can only be added as input; can't be generated as output yet
