## What is AnotherAI?

**AnotherAI turns your AI coding assistant into your AI engineer.**

Let Claude Code, Cursor, and Windsurf operate your AI agents through MCP. Compatible with any programming language and SDK (OpenAI, Vercel AI, PydanticAI, Instructor), access every LLM model from: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, DeepSeek, Mistral, and more. Fully [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai).

**With AnotherAI, your coding assistant becomes an AI engineer that can:**
- **Debug production issues:** "Why is the email parser failing?" → Queries logs, identifies patterns, deploys fix
- **Run experiments:** "Compare GPT-4o vs Claude Sonnet 4 on accuracy and cost" → A/B tests models and prompts with production data
- **Deploy without code changes:** "Make the support bot more concise" → Updates prompts instantly, no PR needed
- **Optimize costs:** "Reduce AI spend by 30%" → Analyzes usage, switches to cheaper models where quality permits
- **Improve from feedback:** "Analyze user feedback for the invoice parser" → Reviews collected feedback, identifies issues, suggests prompt improvements
- **Analyze performance:** "Show response times by model this week" → Generates custom metrics and visualizations
- **Evaluate quality:** "Test if the new prompt maintains accuracy" → Runs evaluation suites, compares against baselines
