## What is AnotherAI?

AnotherAI is an open-source, OpenAI-compatible proxy and MCP server for AI agents. It provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, and improve agentic systems.

<Callout type="info" href="/pricing">
By using AnotherAI, you won't pay more than your current inference costs. We price match the providers and make our margin through volume discounts. [Learn more about our pricing](/pricing).

## Get Started

### Set Up

To use AnotherAI's hosted service: sign up at anotherai.dev/signup [TODO: add link and/or additional steps once we have hosted set up]
<Callout>
Are you interested in a self-hosted, [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai) set up? We have that too! You can learn how to get set up [here](/self-hosted). 
</Callout>

### MCP 

AnotherAI is available as an MCP server in the IDEs below.

<Tabs items={['Cursor', 'Claude Code', 'Cursor CLI']}>

<Tab value="Cursor">

Quick setup (recommended):
1. Complete the [set up](#set-up) steps above
2. Tap on the button below

TODO: confirm if this quick setup will work as is for hosted version as well.

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=anotherai&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2FwaS5hbm90aGVyYWkuZGV2L21jcCJ9Cg=="><img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg" alt="Add anotherai MCP server to Cursor" height="32" /></a>

Manual installation:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `Tools and Integrations`
5. Select `+ New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anotherai": {
      "url": "{{API_URL}}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code">

  1. Complete the set up above
  2. Get your API key at anotherai.dev/... [TODO: add link and/or additional steps once we have hosted set up] 
  3. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
  4. Type the following to install:

TODO: confirm actual claude command for hosted version.

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user anotherai https://api.anotherai.dev/mcp --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  **Installation Scopes**: The `--scope user` flag installs AnotherAI for your personal use across all projects. For team projects, you can use `--scope project` instead to create a shared `.mcp.json` file that can be committed to version control and shared with your team members. Learn more about MCP scopes in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#user-scope).
  </Callout>

  5. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:

  ```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```bash
/mcp 
```

You should see the AnotherAI server listed as "connected".

</Tab>

<Tab value="Cursor CLI">

Cursor CLI can access MCPs configured in your IDE's  `mcp.json` configuration file, enabling the same MCP servers and tools that you've configured for the IDE.

Setup steps:

1. Complete the [set up](#set-up) steps described above and ensure the AnotherAI MCP server is running
2. Configure the AnotherAI MCP in your IDE's `mcp.json` file, as described in the `Cursor` tab.
3. Once the MCP is enabled and active, you can ask the Cursor CLI to interact with it

<Callout type="info">
**Additional Configuration**: If you find that the CLI claims it can't find or use the AnotherAI MCP, you may need to give it the specific file path to use to look for the mcp.json file.
</Callout>

</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Try it out

After you have the above set up completed, AnotherAI is ready to use!

- If you have agents already created, check out how to [migrate them to AnotherAI](/agents/migrating).

- If you don't have any agents built yet, check out [building a new agent](/agents/building) to learn about building a new AnotherAI-compatible agent.


Once you have an agent built or migrated, here are some examples of prompts you can send to Claude Code to test how AnotherAI works:

```bash
Create an experiment in AnotherAI that compares how GPT-5 mini and GPT-4 mini perform on @[your-agent-name-here].
```
```bash
Use AnotherAI to help me find a faster model for @[your-agent-name-here] while still maintaining accuracy.
```
