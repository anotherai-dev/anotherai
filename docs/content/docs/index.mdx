## What is AnotherAI?

AnotherAI is the [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai/anotherai) platform for AI agents. It provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, and improve agentic systems.

## Get Started

### MCP 

AnotherAI is available as a MCP server in the IDEs below.

<Tabs items={['Cursor', 'Claude Code', 'Windsurf']}>

<Tab value="Cursor">

<Callout type="info">**TODO:** Add a direct link to install the MCP.</Callout>

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `Tools and Integrations`
5. Select `+ New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "anotherai": {
         "url": "{{API_URL}}/mcp/",
         "headers": {
           "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
Replace `<your_api_key_here>` with your actual AnotherAI API token.

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code">

1. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
2. Type the following to install:

```bash
claude mcp add anotherai -s user {{API_URL}}/mcp/ --transport http -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your AnotherAI API key.

<Callout type="info">
**Installation Scopes**: The `-s user` flag installs AnotherAI for your personal use across all projects. For team projects, you can use `-s project` instead to create a shared `.mcp.json` file that can be committed to version control and shared with your team members. Learn more about MCP scopes in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#user-scope).
</Callout>

3. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:

```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```bash
/mcp 
```

You should see the AnotherAI server listed as "connected".
