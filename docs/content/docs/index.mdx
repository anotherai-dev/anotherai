## What is AnotherAI?

AnotherAI is the [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai/anotherai) platform for AI agents. It provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, and improve agentic systems.

## Get Started

### Hosted Version Set Up

If you're using AnotherAI's hosted service: sign up at anotherai.dev/signup [TODO: add link and/or additional steps once we have hosted set up]

### Self Host Set Up

To self-host your own instance of AnotherAI, ask Claude Code to do the setup for you by sending the following prompt:

```
claude "Please follow instructions in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai/refs/heads/main/examples/quickstart/INSTRUCTIONS.md"
```

### MCP 

AnotherAI is available as a MCP server in the IDEs below.

<Tabs items={['Cursor (Hosted)', 'Cursor (Self-hosted)', 'Claude Code (Hosted)', 'Claude Code (Self-hosted)']}>

<Tab value="Cursor (Hosted)">

Quick setup  (recommended):
1. Complete the Hosted set up above
2. Tap on the button below 

TODO: confirm if this quick setup will work as is for hosted version as well.

Manual installation:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `Tools and Integrations`
5. Select `+ New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anotherai": {
      "url": "https://api.anotherai.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
You can get your API key on anotherai.dev [TODO: add link and/or additional steps once we have hosted set up]

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code (Hosted)">

  1. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
  2. Type the following to install:

TODO: confirm actual claude command for hosted version.

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user https://api.anotherai.dev/mcp/ --transport http -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  **Installation Scopes**: The `--scope user` flag installs AnotherAI for your personal use across all projects. For team projects, you can use `--scope project` instead to create a shared `.mcp.json` file that can be committed to version control and shared with your team members. Learn more about MCP scopes in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#user-scope).
  </Callout>

  3. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:

  ```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```bash
/mcp 
```

You should see the AnotherAI server listed as "connected".

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code (Self-hosted)">

  1. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
  2. Type the following to install:

  **For self-hosted version:**

### Try it out

After you have the above set up completed, AnotherAI is ready to use!

- If you have agents already created, check out how to migrate them to AnotherAI. [TODO: link to applicable page once https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai/pull/29 is merged]

- If you don't have any agents built yet, check out [TODO: link to applicable page once https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai/pull/29 is merged] to learn about building a new AnotherAI-compatible agent.


Here are some examples of prompts you can send to Claude Code to test how AnotherAI works:

```
Create an experiment in AnotherAI that compares how GPT-5 mini and GPT-4 mini perform on @[your-agent-name-here].
```
```
Use AnotherAI to help me find a faster model for @[your-agent-name-here] while still maintaining acurracy.
```

### Build a new agent 

```bash
Can you write a agent to classify emails as urgent or not?
```

### Migrate an existing agent

```bash
Can you migrate the following agent to AnotherAI?
```
