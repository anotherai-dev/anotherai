## What is AnotherAI?

**AnotherAI is a MCP server designed for AI engineering tasks.**

**With AnotherAI, your AI assistant becomes an AI engineer that can:**
- **[Build new agents](/use-cases/fundamentals/building):** Tests [100+ models](/features/models) from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google & more, optimizes prompts, compares quality vs. cost vs. speed
- **[Debug production issues](/use-cases/fundamentals/debugging):** `Why is the email parser failing?` → Queries logs, identifies patterns, deploys fix
- **[Run experiments](/use-cases/checking-new-models):** `Compare GPT-4o vs Claude vs Gemini on quality, cost and latency` → Compare models and prompts with synthetic or production data
- **[Deploy without code changes](/use-cases/fundamentals/deployments):** Updates prompts and models instantly, without a deployment.
- **[Optimize costs](/use-cases/lowering-costs):** "Reduce AI spend by 30%" → Analyzes usage, switches to cheaper models where quality permits
- **[Improve from feedback](/use-cases/user-feedback):** Collect users's feedback, automated AI review of feedbacks, identifies issues, suggests improvements
- **[Analyze performance](/use-cases/fundamentals/metrics):** `Show response times by model this week` → Generates custom metrics and visualizations
- **[Evaluate quality](/use-cases/fundamentals/evaluating):** `Test if the new prompt maintains accuracy` → Runs evaluation suites, compares against baselines
