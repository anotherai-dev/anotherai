## What is AnotherAI?

AnotherAI is the [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai/anotherai) platform for AI agents. It provides the developer tools and cloud infrastructure to build, deploy, monitor, evaluate, and improve agentic systems.

## Get Started

### Self Host Set UP

First, you'll need to self-host your own instance ofAnotherAI. Ask Claude Code to do the setup for you by sending the following prompt:

```
claude "Please follow instructions in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai/refs/heads/main/examples/quickstart/INSTRUCTIONS.md"
```

### MCP 

AnotherAI is available as a MCP server in the IDEs below.

<Tabs items={['Cursor', 'Claude Code', 'Windsurf']}>

<Tab value="Cursor">

Quick setup  (recommended):
1. Complete the Self Host set up above and make sure the AnotherAI MCP server is running.
2. Tap on this button below

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=anotherai&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vMTI3LjAuMC4xOjgwMDAvbWNwLyJ9"><img src="https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg" alt="Add anotherai MCP server to Cursor" height="32" /></a>

Manual installation:

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `Tools and Integrations`
5. Select `+ New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

   ```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anotherai": {
      "url": "{{API_URL}}/mcp/"
    }
  }
}
   ```

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code">

1. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
2. Type the following to install:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user --transport http anotherai {{API_URL}}/mcp/
```

<Callout type="info">
**Installation Scopes**: The `--scope user` flag installs AnotherAI for your personal use across all projects. For team projects, you can use `--scope project` instead to create a shared `.mcp.json` file that can be committed to version control and shared with your team members. Learn more about MCP scopes in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#user-scope).
</Callout>

3. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:

```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```bash
/mcp 
```

You should see the AnotherAI server listed as "connected".


</Tab>

</Tabs>

### Try out some prompts

After you have the above self-hosting configuration and MCP set up, now you can try it. Here are some sample prompts you can send to Claude Code to get you started:

```
Create an experiment in AnotherAI that compares how GPT-5 mini and GPT-4 mini extract the sentiment from an input product review.
```
```
Use AnotherAI to help me find the model that can summarize a long article the fastest.
```
```
Use AnotherAI to test how clearly and accurately 5 different models can answer complex STEM questions.
```

### Build a new agent 

```bash
Can you write a agent to classify emails as urgent or not?
```

### Migrate an existing agent

```bash
Can you migrate the following agent to AnotherAI?
```
