## What are AnotherAI API keys used for?

AnotherAI API key enable you to:

- Connect your IDE to AnotherAI via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Run your agents using AnotherAI's API
- Access 100+ different models from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, and more without managing individual API keys

## Creating API Keys

### Via Web App

If you're just setting up AnotherAI and don't have the MCP connected yet, you'll need to create your first API key through the web app.

1. Log in to AnotherAI (or sign up if you haven't already)
2. Select **API Keys** in the left sidebar
3. Select the **+ New API Key** button
4. Copy and save the generated API key

You can learn more about setting up AnotherAI [here](/#get-started)

  API keys are only displayed once. Store your key securely as you won't be able to view it again after leaving the
  page.

### Via MCP

Once you have the AnotherAI MCP set up, you can simply ask Claude Code (or your preferred coding agent) to create an API key for you using the AnotherAI MCP.

This method is particularly useful when developing agents, as it eliminates the need to switch to the web app to create a new API key manually.

## Deleting API Keys

API keys can only be deleted through the web app:

1. Log in to AnotherAI
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the left sidebar
3. Select the API key you want to delete
4. Click **Delete**

<Callout type="warning">
  Before deleting an API key, ensure it's not being used by any active agents or integrations. Deletion will immediately
  break any services using that key.
