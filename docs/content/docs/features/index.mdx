TODO: NEEDS UPDATING TO REFLECT THE NEW SECTION NAME/CONTENT

AnotherAI's inference API provides a unified, OpenAI-compatible interface for accessing AI models from multiple providers. With built-in features like structured outputs, caching, and cost tracking, it's designed for production-scale AI applications.

- **OpenAI Compatible** - Drop-in replacement for OpenAI's API. Use your existing code with minimal changes.
- **Multi-Provider Support** - Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more through a single API endpoint.
- **Structured Outputs** - Generate type-safe JSON responses using Pydantic, Zod, or JSON Schema for reliable data extraction.
- **Cost Monitoring** - Track estimated costs per request with detailed metadata showing token usage and pricing information.
- **Request Caching** - Reduce costs and latency by automatically caching repeated requests with configurable TTL settings.
