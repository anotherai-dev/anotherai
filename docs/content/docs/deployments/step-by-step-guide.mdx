This guide walks you through the process of deploying a version of your agent using AnotherAI and your AI coding agent.

## Creating a Deployment

<Steps>
<Step>
### Select the Version You Want to Deploy

1. Open [anotherai.dev](https://anotherai.dev)
2. Locate the experiment that has the version of the agent you want to deploy.
3. Hover over the version number to copy the version ID

</Step>

<Step>
### Ask your Agent to Deploy the Version

1. Open Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent)
2. Request that your AI Agent deploys the version to your preferred [environment](#common-environment-names) and paste the version ID.

```
I want to deploy anotherai/deployment/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e to production.
```

3. Optionally, you can request a specific name be used for the deployment. Otherwise, your AI coding agent will pick one for you automatically.

```
I want to deploy anotherai/deployment/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e to production.
Name the deployment: "calendar-assistant/production-9-2"
```

#### Common environment names

- `dev` - for development testing
- `staging` - for pre-production validation
- `production` or `prod` - for live production use
</Step>

<Step>
### Update Your Code

Once the deployment is created, ask Claude to update your code to use the new deployment.

```
Update my agent code to use the new deployment travel-assistant/production#1
```

Claude will update your code to use the deployment reference, removing the static components that are now stored in the deployment.

  model: "gpt-4o",
  messages: [

  // Input variables

            "role": "system",
            "content": """You are an expert on {{ country }}. 
                         You are helping a customer traveling to {{ country }}. 
                         Answer questions in {{ language }}."""
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": user_question}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    extra_body={
        "input": {
            "country": destination,
            "language": user_language
        },
        "agent_id": "travel-assistant"
    }
)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

**After:**

<Tabs items={["OpenAI SDK (JS)", "OpenAI SDK (Python)"]}>
<Tab>
```js
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  //Static components are now stored in the deployment
  model: "anotherai/travel-assistant/production#1",
  messages: [
    // Dynamic user messages remain in code
    { role: "user", content: userQuestion }
  ],
  input: {
    country: destination,
    language: userLanguage
  }
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```python
completion = await openai.chat.completions.create(
    # Model, temperature, system message, and agent_id are now in the deployment
    model="anotherai/travel-assistant/production#1",
    messages=[
        # Only dynamic user messages remain in code
        {"role": "user", "content": user_question}
    ],
    extra_body={
        "input": {
            "country": destination,
            "language": user_language
        }
    }
)
```

## Updating a Deployment

There are two types of deployment updates that can be made: breaking and non-breaking. To learn more about the differences, read more [here](./index#creating-new-vs-updating-existing-deployments).

### Non-Breaking Changes (Update Existing Deployment)

When your changes don't affect the input variables or output schema, you can update the existing deployment:

<Steps>
<Step>
Copy the new version ID you want to deploy from [AnotherAI](https://anotherai.dev).
</Step>

<Step>
  Ask Claude to update the existing deployment: ``` Update deployment travel-assistant/production#1 to use
  anotherai/deployment/a9f1fc5ab11299a9fee5604e51fe7b6e ```
</Step>

<Step>Confirm the update in the AnotherAI web app when prompted.</Step>

<Step>
That's it! **No code changes needed** - your application automatically uses the updated version.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Breaking Changes (Create New Deployment)

When your changes affect input variables or output schema, you must create a new deployment:

<Steps>
<Step>
Copy the new version ID you want to deploy from [AnotherAI](https://anotherai.dev).
</Step>

<Step>
  Ask Claude to deploy the new version to your preferred environment in a new deployment. Alternatively, if you ask
  Claude to update an existing deployment and it cannot because the new version is incompatible, Claude will
  automatically create a new deployment for you.
</Step>

<Step>
Update your code to use the new deployment name:
```
Update my code to use travel-assistant/production#2 instead of travel-assistant/production#1
```
</Step>
</Steps>
