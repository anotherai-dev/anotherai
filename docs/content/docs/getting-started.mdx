## Set Up

To use AnotherAI's hosted service: go to [https://anotherai.dev/](https://anotherai.dev/) and sign up to create a free account.
<Callout>
Are you interested in a self-hosted, [open-source](https://github.com/anotherai-dev/anotherai) set up? We have that too! You can learn how to get set up [here](/self-hosted).

### MCP 

AnotherAI is available as an MCP server in the IDEs below.

<Tabs items={['Cursor', 'Claude Code', 'Windsurf', 'Cursor CLI']}>

<Tab value="Cursor">

1. Open Cursor
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Navigate to `Cursor Settings`
4. Select `Tools and Integrations`
5. Select `+ New MCP Server`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anotherai": {
      "url": "{{API_URL}}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Cursor UI should now look like this (note the green indicator and the number of tools enabled displayed):

</Tab>

<Tab value="Claude Code">

  1. Complete the set up above
  2. Get your API key on [anotherai.dev/](https://anotherai.dev/completions?showManageKeysModal=true) 
  3. Open Claude Code in your preferred terminal (standalone or within your IDE).
  4. Type the following to install:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --scope user anotherai {{API_URL}}/mcp --transport http --header "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
  ```

  <Callout type="info">
  **Installation Scopes**: The `--scope user` flag installs AnotherAI for your personal use across all projects. For team projects, you can use `--scope project` instead to create a shared `.mcp.json` file that can be committed to version control and shared with your team members. Learn more about MCP scopes in the [Anthropic documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#user-scope).
  </Callout>

  5. Type the following to verify the server is properly connected:

  ```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```bash
/mcp 
```

You should see the AnotherAI server listed as "connected".

</Tab>

<Tab value="Windsurf">

1. Open Windsurf
2. Go to `Settings...`
3. Select `Windsurf Settings`
4. Navigate to `Cascade`
5. Select `Manage MCPs`
6. Select `View Raw Config`

Add the following configuration to your MCP servers config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anotherai": {
      "url": "{{API_URL}}/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <your_api_key_here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Navigate back to Manage MCPs and refresh the page. The AnotherAI MCP should appear and show as enabled.

</Tab>

<Tab value="Cursor CLI">

Cursor CLI can access MCPs configured in your IDE's  `mcp.json` configuration file, enabling the same MCP servers and tools that you've configured for the IDE.

Setup steps:

1. Complete the [set up](#set-up) steps described above and ensure the AnotherAI MCP server is running
2. Configure the AnotherAI MCP in your IDE's `mcp.json` file, as described in the `Cursor` tab.
3. Once the MCP is enabled and active, you can ask the Cursor CLI to interact with it

<Callout type="info">
**Additional Configuration**: If you find that the CLI claims it can't find or use the AnotherAI MCP, you may need to give it the specific file path to use to look for the mcp.json file.
</Callout>

## Try it out

After you have the above set up completed, AnotherAI is ready to use!

- If you have agents already created, check out how to [migrate them to AnotherAI](/agents/migrating).

- If you don't have any agents built yet, check out [building a new agent](/agents/building) to learn about building a new AnotherAI-compatible agent.
