## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why can't I select a completion from a dashboard view?

If you're unable to select a completion from a view in your dashboard, it's likely because the `SELECT` statement in your query is missing the `id` field. 

The `id` field is required for the UI to create clickable links to individual completions. Make sure your query includes the completion ID:

```sql
-- ❌ Bad: Missing id field
SELECT agent_id, cost_usd, duration_seconds 
FROM completions 
WHERE created_at >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY

--  Good: Includes id field
SELECT id, agent_id, cost_usd, duration_seconds 
FROM completions 
WHERE created_at >= now() - INTERVAL 30 DAY
```

When the `id` field is included, each row in your view will be clickable, allowing you to navigate to the detailed completion view.
