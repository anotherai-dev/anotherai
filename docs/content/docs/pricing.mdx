AnotherAI offers a pay-as-you-go model, like AWS. There are no fixed costs, minimum spends, or annual commitments. You can start without talking to sales.

## Simple pricing promise

<Callout type="success">
    AnotherAI matches the per-token price of all LLM providers, so AnotherAI **costs the same as using providers directly**.

## How we make money

Behind every AI model, there are two ways to pay for inference: buy tokens from providers, or rent GPU capacity directly to run models yourself.

Individual customers typically buy tokens because their usage is sporadic: they can't justify renting GPUs that sit idle most of the time. Even when GPUs aren't processing requests, you're still paying for them.

AnotherAI pools demand from many customers, creating consistent 24/7 throughput that maximizes GPU utilization. This allows us to rent GPU capacity directly instead of buying tokens, securing much better rates.

We pass the standard token pricing to you while capturing the cost savings from efficient GPU utilization. That's how we match provider prices while staying profitable.

## FAQ

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do you guarantee the same pricing as direct providers?">
We monitor provider pricing in real-time and automatically match their per-token rates. If you ever find a discrepancy, we'll refund the difference and update our pricing immediately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use my existing provider credits with AnotherAI?">
Yes, you can connect your own API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and other providers to use your existing credits while still benefiting from AnotherAI's tools and infrastructure.

When using your own API keys, AnotherAI doesn't charge for inference tokens - you pay your provider directly. We only charge for [built-in tools](/agents/tools) that your agents use (like web search, browser, etc.).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is usage tracked and billed?">
You're only charged for tokens actually consumed by your agents and any tools they use. We provide detailed [usage analytics](/observability/costs) so you can see exactly what you're paying for. Billing is monthly with no minimums.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if my usage is very high or very low?">
Our pricing scales linearly with no minimums or commitments. For most customers, our pooled model provides better economics than going direct. 

If you're spending over $25,000/month on LLM usage, you have two options: use your own API keys with AnotherAI to get your negotiated rates, or contact us to apply volume discounts to your account.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How does this compare to running my own infrastructure?">
Unless you can maintain 24/7 GPU utilization (which requires significant scale), our pooled model will be more cost-effective than renting your own GPUs while providing better reliability and no infrastructure management overhead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is there a free tier?">
Data storage, unlimited agents, team collaboration, and bandwidth are completely free. You only pay for the AI inference tokens your agents actually use.
</Accordion>
