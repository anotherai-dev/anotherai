## SQL Query Tool Security

The SQL query tool in AnotherAI provides powerful observability capabilities while maintaining strict security boundaries to protect your data.

### Technical Implementation

Our SQL query security is built on [ClickHouse's robust access control system](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/access-rights):

- **Read-only access**: All SQL queries are executed with [read-only permissions](https://clickhouse.com/docs/operations/settings/permissions-for-queries), preventing any data modification, deletion, or schema changes
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**: Each customer operates within isolated security contexts using ClickHouse's role-based permission system
- **Query validation**: All queries are validated before execution to ensure they comply with security policies

### Security Guarantees

**What you CAN do:**
- Execute SELECT queries to analyze your completions data
- Use aggregations, filters, and joins within your data scope
- Export query results for further analysis
- Create complex analytical queries for insights

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify, delete, or insert data
- Access other customers' data
- Alter database schemas or tables
- Execute system-level commands
- Bypass row-level security policies

### Data Isolation

- **Customer segregation**: Each customer's data is logically isolated using row-level security
- **Query scope**: Queries are automatically scoped to your organization's data only
