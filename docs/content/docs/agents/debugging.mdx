# Debugging Agent Issues

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

If you noticed issues with your agent, the easiest way to debug is to use Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent) to investigate the issue.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Identify the Problem

Find the completion(s) in AnotherAI that have the issues you want to address

</Step>

<Step>

### Link to Claude Code

Once you've identified a problematic completion:

1. **Copy the completion ID** from the completions detail view (you can find the button in the top right of the modal)
2. **Open Claude Code** or your preferred AI coding agent in your terminal or IDE
3. **Share the completion ID** and describe the issue you're experiencing
4. **Ask Claude to investigate** the specific completion

Example:
```
This completion anotherai/completion/0198c34b-ff24-73cb-57d8-a67851e0cf10 
input tone was enthusiastic, but the rewritten email isn't very enthusiastic. 
Help me understand what's going wrong.
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Claude Does the Rest!

Claude Code will debug for you by examining the completion and agent details and input variables. After the issue is identified, you can use the Claude Code to help you rewrite your agent's code to fix the issue.

## Common Issues Claude Can Help Debug

- **Prompt engineering problems** - Suboptimal prompts leading to poor outputs
- **Input validation issues** - Malformed or unexpected input data
- **Model selection problems** - Wrong model chosen for the task
- **Cost optimization** - Identifying expensive patterns or inefficient configurations
- **Performance bottlenecks** - Slow completions or timeout issues
