## Migrating From OpenAI to AnotherAI

<Steps>
<Step>

### Update your base URL

The only change you need to make is updating the `base_url`. 

<Tabs items={['Python', 'JavaScript/TypeScript']}>
<Tab value="Python">

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Just update the base_url
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.anotherai.com/v1",
)

# Your existing code works as-is
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}
    ]
)
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="JavaScript/TypeScript">

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Just update the baseURL 
const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.anotherai.com/v1',
});

// Your existing code works as-is
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hello, world!' }
  ],
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Verify your agent is working

Test your agent by running it once. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the completion appear at anotherai.dev/completions.

</Step>

<Step>

### You're done!

Your agent is now integrated with AnotherAI, giving you access to:

- **100+ AI Models**: Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Real-time Observability**: Monitor costs, performance, and errors
- **Prompt Deployments**: Update prompts without code changes

</Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

- [Improving Agents](/agents/improving) - Optimize prompts and model selection
- [Deployments](/deployments/index) - Update prompts without changing code
