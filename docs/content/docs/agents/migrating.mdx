## Migrating From OpenAI to AnotherAI

### Recommended: Use Claude Code for Automatic Migration

The easiest way to migrate your agent is to ask Claude Code (or your preferred AI coding agent) to handle it for you:

```
Can you migrate my agent at @[your-agent-file-path] to use AnotherAI? 
I want to keep all the existing functionality while gaining access to 
AnotherAI's features
```

### Manual Migration Steps

If you prefer to migrate manually or want to understand what changes are needed, follow the steps below.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Update your configuration

There are three main steps to migrating your agent to AnotherAI:

1. Update your OpenAI client configuration to point to AnotherAI's base URL. (Required)
2. Add an `agent_id` in the agent's metadata. This ensures that each agent can be distinguished in AnotherAI's webview. (Recommended)
3. (For cloud-hosted AnotherAI only) Replace your provider API keys with an AnotherAI API key to allow easy access to 100+ different models. (Recommended)

<Tab value="Python / OpenAI SDK">

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.anotherai.dev/v1",  # Or http://localhost:8000/v1 for self-hosted
    api_key="aai-***",  # Update to your AnotherAI API key (not required if self-hosting)
)

# Your existing code works as-is
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}
    ],
    metadata={
        "agent_id": "your-agent-name",  # Recommended for observability
    }
)
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Node (OpenAI SDK)">

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: 'https://api.anotherai.dev/v1',  // Or http://localhost:8000/v1 for self-hosted
  apiKey: 'aai-***',  // Update to your AnotherAI API key (not required if self-hosting)
});

// Your existing code works as-is
const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hello, world!' }
  ],
  metadata: {
    agent_id: 'your-agent-name',  // Recommended for observability
  }
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

</Step>

<Step>

### Verify your agent is working

Test your agent by running it once. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the completion appear at https://anotherai.dev/completions.

</Step>

<Step>

### You're done!

Your agent is now integrated with AnotherAI, giving you access to:

- **100+ AI Models**: Access models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more
- **Real-time Observability**: Monitor costs, performance, and errors
- **Prompt Deployments**: Update prompts without code changes

</Step>
</Steps>
