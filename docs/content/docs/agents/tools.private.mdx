## What are tools?

Tools are a way to extend the capabilities of your AI agent.

Real-life use cases for tools:
- Search the web to gather the latest news about a company or topic.
- Browse a specific web page to extract information for a report.
- Execute a SQL query to fetch monthly sales data from a company database.
- Search in a vector database to find similar documents or images based on content.
- Send an email to a prospect after identifying information about their company online.

### Using tools from code

AnotherAI is fully compatible with the `tools` parameter from the OpenAI `chat.completions` API, so you can use your existing code without modification.

For more details, refer to OpenAI's documentation on [tools and function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

```python
tools = [{
    "type": "function",
    "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current temperature for a given location.",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {
                    "type": "string",
                    "description": "City and country e.g. Bogot√°, Colombia"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "location"
            ],
            "additionalProperties": False
        },
        "strict": True
    }
}]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like in Paris today?"}],
    tools=tools
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls)
```
