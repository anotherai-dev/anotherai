Apple Inc. announced its quarterly earnings yesterday, reporting revenue of $89.5 billion, slightly below analyst expectations of $90.2 billion. The tech giant's iPhone sales remained strong, accounting for 52% of total revenue, while services division showed impressive 15% year-over-year growth. However, iPad and Mac sales declined by 8% and 5% respectively, attributed to supply chain constraints and reduced consumer spending on electronics. CEO Tim Cook expressed optimism about the company's AI initiatives and upcoming product launches. The company also announced a $110 billion share buyback program, the largest in its history.
